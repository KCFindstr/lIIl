## Overview

### What is lIIl?

lIIl is a programming language that is designed to be intuitive and easy to use. There are many pain points in existing programming languages, and to my surprise almost all coding communities refuse to address any of them. lIIl is designed to solve these problems and is the next-generation programming language that will dominate the programming world in the unforeseen future.

### Why lIIl?

#### Exceptional Performance

We have verified that lIIl's performance is much more remarkable than other commonly used languages, such as POOOOn, JOOa, O++, etc. (censored to avoid hate from their crazy fans)

#### Intuitive Syntax

lIIl's syntax is so intuitive that you instantly tell what it does by looking at the code, without any prior knowledge of lIIl. For example, the following code is a valid lIIl program:

```lIIl
del cpu.

mian << OvO {
  "Hello world: " >> op@cpu.
  make sum 0.
  make first O.
  loli OvO > 0 {
    !first nara " + " >> op@cpu.
    make first X.
    OvO >> op@cpu.
    make sum sum + OvO.
    make OvO OvO - 1.
  }
  (" = " + sum + "\n") >> op@cpu.
}

10 >> mian.
```

Let's dig into this line by line.

```lIIl
del cpu.
```

In lIIl, statements terminate with period `.` instead of `;` in some other languages. In this way, you can write programs as if you are writing a poem rather than long and tedious paragaphs that never end.

Everyone with basic knowledge on computers can immediately figure out `del` is short for **d**eclare **e**xternal **l**ibrary and `cpu` is **c**onsole **p**rinting **u**nit. For those who use unix operating systems more than Microsoft Windows, `del` has an alias `rm`, which is short for **r**egister **m**odule. That's how intuitive lIIl is!
